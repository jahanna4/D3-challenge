# D3.js Challenge

The purpose of this project was to analyze trends shaping people's lives.

Data was provided by The U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set was based on the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates and included data on rates of Poverty, Age, Income, Healthcare, Obesity and Smoking status. MOE stands for "margin of error." Data was provided in .CSV format and read in using D3.csv. The data was then used to create a scatter plot comparing Obesity and Income. The scatter plot revealed a negative correlation between Obesity and Income.
