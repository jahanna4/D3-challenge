          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income</h2>
          <p>In a random sampling study conducted across 51 states, information was collected regarding Poverty, Age, Income, 
            Healthcare, Obesity, and Smoking status. With the vast amount of data, one can imagine the possibilities of comparisons
            to determine what, if any, correlations exist between these various factors.</p>

          <p>The study above was focused on researching trends between Obesity and Income in study participants. As noted in the graph
            above, it appears as though there is a negative correlation between Obesity and Income. Our findings indicate that as income
            decreases, obesity increases. This could be due to any number of contributing factors. However, purely based on these two
            measurements, the highest levels of obesity were found in the lowest income brackets</p>
